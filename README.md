# Purpose
I saw a great tutorial for creating a password generator using plain Javascript and I wanted to do a ReactJS version of it.
I also was trying out using Styled-Components for the first time and I really enjoyed using them so I added a little theme switcher to the "app".

**Quick Note:**
I am uploading this because I am interested in front-end development.
It's only intended to be a fun portfolio piece.
Be sure to check out the dev branch to see the code.

Feel free to look around and feedback is always welcome.
